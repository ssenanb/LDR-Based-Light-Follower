# LDR-Based-Light-Follower

-> Project Description
This project uses 2 LDRs to detect ambient light and rotates the servo motor to the opposite side of the LDR where the light intensity is low. Thus, the servo moves to the area with higher light. Also, the servo position (turned right or left) is printed on the LCD screen.
